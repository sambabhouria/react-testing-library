# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


The React Testing Library is a very lightweight solution for testing React components. It provides
light utility functions on top of react-dom and react-dom/test-utils, in a way that encourages better testing practices. Its primary guiding principle is:


# # The more your tests resemble the way your software is used, the more confidence they can give you.


#  Installation

npm install --save-dev @testing-library/react

or

yarn add --dev @testing-library/react
