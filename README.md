# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


The React Testing Library is a very lightweight solution for testing React components. It provides
light utility functions on top of react-dom and react-dom/test-utils, in a way that encourages better testing practices. Its primary guiding principle is:


# # The more your tests resemble the way your software is used, the more confidence they can give you.

This is an example project of how to test react components using react-testing-library and Jest.
The @testing-library family of packages helps you test UI components in a user-centric way.
#  Installation
